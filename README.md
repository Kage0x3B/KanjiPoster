# KanjiPos [![Build Status](https://ci.syscy.de/buildStatus/icon?job=KanjiPoster)](https://ci.syscy.de/job/KanjiPoster/)
A Kanji poster generator for creating huge posters with grids containing information on kanji such as readings, meaning etc.

The program has already been tested and used for simple kanji posters but might be a bit hard to use for anything widely different than kanji posters with an index, kanji, readings etc.
I might add documentation on how to use the program and sample files in the future if anyone is interested in it.

If you have any questions, contact me at [moritz.hein@live.de](mailto:moritz.hein@live.de?subject=KanjiPos).
